<h2>About</h2>
<p> My name is Elaine, and here's a little background about myself!
 <br>
 <br><b>Education:</b> I studied Accounting and Financial Management at the University of Waterloo, but eventually discovered that my passions are more in line with data analysis and visualization. </br>
 <br><b>Professional Work Experience:</b></br>
 <br> - I've worked as a Business Analyst in the Capital Markets devision of Scotiabank, within their Global Wholesale Risk Technology department. </br>
 <br> - More recently, I've worked in two different capacities at my current firm, a mobile gaming company called Uken Games. I was a data analyst on the Marketing team, and then moved to the central IT team as Business Intelligence Lead. </br>
 <br><b>Fun Facts:</b> I absolutely love reading and creating artwork. In my spare time, you can usually catch me cozying up to a book with some hot tea (currently reading "Range" by David Epstein), listening to some great podcasts (HBR IdeaCast/Women At Work, Stanford GSB: View From The Top, Linear Regressions, The Knowledge Project) while doing chores, or doodling away in a notebook. I also love learning new things, and so I've captured a couple learning goals for 2021 below. </br>
 <br><b>2021 Learning Goals:</b> I'm currently engaging in self study to develop a deeper understanding of business analytics and machine learning applications. Courses I'm working on now: <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/the-analytics-edge">The Analytics Edge from edX</a>, <a href="https://dimensionless.in/data-science-using-python/">Dimensionless Technologies' Data Science Specialization</a>. </br>
