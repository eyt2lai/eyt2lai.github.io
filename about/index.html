<h2>About</h2>
<p> My name is Elaine, and here's a little background about myself!
 <br>
 <br><b>Education:</b> I studied Accounting and Financial Management at the University of Waterloo, but eventually discovered that my passions are more in line with data analysis and visualization. </br>
 <br><b>Professional Work Experience:</b></br>
 <br> - I've worked as a Business Analyst in the Capital Markets devision of Scotiabank, within their Global Wholesale Technology department. </br>
 <br> - More recently, I've worked in two different capacities at my current firm, a mobile gaming company called Uken Games. I was a data analyst on the Marketing team, and then moved to the central IT team as Business Intelligence Lead. </br>
 <br><b>Fun Facts:</b> I absolutely love reading and creating artwork. In my spare time, you can usually catch me cozying up to a book with some hot tea (currently reading "Range" by David Epstein) or doodling away in a sketching pad. </br>
