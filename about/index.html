  <b><i> I am a practitioner of continuous learning. My ultimate joy in life stems from deriving innovative solutions for the benefit of others. 
  <br> Currently, my passions involve deploying data-driven strategies for solving practical human conundrums. 
  <br> On the side, I am constantly on the lookout for self reinvention/improvement via employing learnings from books I've read. Visit my blog for my takeaways on my favourite books to date!</i></b>

 <h3>Some Summary Notes:</h3>
 <br><b>Education:</b> I studied Accounting and Financial Management at the University of Waterloo. Through subsequent employment, however, I eventually discovered that my passions lie with data analysis and visualization. </br>
 <br><b> Professional Work Experience: </b></br>
 <br> 1. I've worked as a Business Analyst in the Capital Markets devision of Scotiabank, within their Global Wholesale Risk Technology department. </br>
 <br> 2. More recently, I've worked in two different capacities at my current firm, a mobile gaming company called UKEN Games. I was a data analyst on the Marketing team, and then moved to the central IT team as Business Intelligence Lead. </br>
 <br><b> Fun Facts: </b> I absolutely love reading and creating artwork! In my spare time, you can usually catch me cozying up to a book with some hot tea (currently reading "Range" by David Epstein), listening to some great podcasts (HBR IdeaCast/Women At Work, Stanford GSB: View From The Top, Linear Regressions, The Knowledge Project) while doing chores, or doodling away in a notebook. </br>
 <br><b> 2021 Learning Goals: </b> I'm currently engaging in self study to develop a deeper understanding of business analytics and machine learning applications. Courses I'm working on now: <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/the-analytics-edge">The Analytics Edge from edX</a>, <a href="https://dimensionless.in/data-science-using-python/">Dimensionless Technologies' Data Science Specialization</a>. </br>
